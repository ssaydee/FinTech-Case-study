Abstract:
Connectivity and accessibility are some of the benefits the internet gives us. With a push of a button, people are able to communicate, see each other, order and pay for things, and even work from another continent. The power of the internet is also allowing people in remote parts of the world to learn and see things and  people that they wouldn’t have had an opportunity to interact with without, vice versa. This paper will focus briefly on the history/timeline of the internet and the transition into the dotcom era which lead to ecommerce/marketplace. We will also see  how the internet helped propel the field of FinTech. The majority of this paper will be focusing on one company (Stripe Inc) within the Payment/billing domain and how they are adding value to its customers.
